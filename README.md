# HotelFindr
### Status: Work in progress

A small project of a booking site that began as a technical assessment

#### Tasks
- [ ] Catch up with unit tests
- [ ] Improve styling
- [ ] Store the reservations
- [ ] Add more hotels
- [ ] Create user logic with login
- [ ] Review responsiveness, maybe MaterialUI is not well-implemented
- [ ] Change vite due to incompatibility with jest

#### Ideas
- Add animations on the grid when the options pop up
- Scrap hotel data from other sites
- Allow list view for comparison
- Add payment methods
